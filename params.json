{"name":"Zfs-auto-snapshot","tagline":"ZFS Snapshot Service for Linux and Macosx with send and receive","body":"zfs-auto-snapshot:\r\n\r\nAn alternative implementation of the zfs-auto-snapshot service for Linux\r\nand Macosx (currently tested and compatible with ZEVO Community Edition).\r\n\r\nIt can automatically create, rotate, and destroy periodic ZFS snapshots. This\r\nis utility that creates the @zfs-auto-snap_frequent, @zfs-auto-snap_hourly,\r\n@zfs-auto-snap_daily, @zfs-auto-snap_weekly, and @zfs-auto-snap_monthly\r\nsnapshots if it is installed.\r\n\r\nIt can backup (send) the snapshots to remote systems or external disks,\r\nutilizing zfs send command. On darwin this can replace TimeMachine backups,\r\ncurrently not running on top of ZFS filesystems.\r\n\r\nThis program is a posixly correct bourne shell script. It depends on zfs utilities\r\nonly (Linux). Unfortunatelly on Darwin it needs 'getopt' from macports.\r\n\r\nFor using --send option, adapt opt_sendtocmd variable accordingly by editing the\r\nscript zfs-auto-snapshot.sh.\r\n\r\n    sudo make OSTYPE=linux|darwin install\r\n    \r\n    installs cron / launchd startup scripts and copies script to /usr/sbin\r\ndirectory.\r\n\r\n    On darwin for daily, weekly and monthly stuff, anacron install is highly\r\nrecommended.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
